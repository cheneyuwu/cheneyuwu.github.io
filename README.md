# website

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The website design is just a modification of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/).

## convert images
* Run `_make_favicon.sh` script generates website avatar
* Run `_make_thumbnails.sh` script generates them and the html template looks in `tn/` for all images.
